## CV-Convert: GUI tool to handle conversion of computer vision object detection datasets formats

Welcome! I built CV-Convert to provide an accessible tool to locally convert your object detection datasets between different formats. This is useful since object detection models usually expect a specific format.

This tool unique features are:
- Simple GUI layout to avoid the hassle of coding or writing commands.
- Runs locally, making it secure and private
- Free
- Open Source

## Supported Formats

Currently, the tool supports conversion between the following formats:

YOLO (V5 and V8)
COCO (.json file)
Pascal VOC (.xml files per annotation)

Please feel free to let me know what other formats you want to see here!
